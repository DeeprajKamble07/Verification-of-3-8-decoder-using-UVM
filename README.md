# Verification-of-3-8-decoder-using-UVM

The objective of this project is to verify the functional correctness of a 3:8 decoder using a UVM-based verification environment. The decoder takes a 3-bit input and generates an 8-bit one-hot output, where exactly one output line is asserted corresponding to the input value. A structured UVM testbench is developed consisting of key components such as sequence item, sequence, driver, monitor, agent, environment, and test, all connected through a virtual interface to the DUT.

The verification environment uses constrained-random stimulus to apply all valid input combinations, while the monitor captures DUT activity and sends it to the scoreboard. The scoreboard compares the actual DUT output with the expected one-hot decoded output generated by a reference model. Functional coverage is used to ensure that all input combinations are exercised. This UVM-based methodology improves reusability, scalability, and confidence in the correctness of the 3:8 decoder design before synthesis or tape-out.
